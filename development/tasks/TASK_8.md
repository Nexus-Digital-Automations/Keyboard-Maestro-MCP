## 🔧 Implementation Files (Will modify/create)
- [x] `src/tools/email_operations.py` - Email sending and management tools (240 lines)
- [x] `src/tools/messaging_operations.py` - SMS/iMessage tools (243 lines)
- [x] `src/tools/notification_operations.py` - System notification tools (248 lines)
- [x] `src/core/communication_core.py` - Core communication logic (365 lines - comprehensive)
- [x] `tests/tools/test_communication_tools.py` - Communication tool tests (391 lines - comprehensive)

## 🏗️ Modularity Strategy
- [x] Separate email operations from messaging and notifications
- [x] Extract common communication patterns into core logic module
- [x] Create focused modules for different communication channels
- [x] Maintain clear separation: tools → core logic → validation
- [x] Design reusable patterns for different communication types
- [x] Isolate service-specific logic (email vs SMS vs notifications)

## 📖 Reference Dependencies (Context/validation)
- [x] `development/TYPES.md` - Communication data types and contact validation
- [x] `development/ERRORS.md` - Communication error handling and service failures
- [x] `development/TESTING.md` - Communication testing with mock services

## 📦 Expected Output Artifacts
- [x] Email tools in `src/tools/email_operations.py` (240 lines)
- [x] Messaging tools in `src/tools/messaging_operations.py` (243 lines)
- [x] Notification tools in `src/tools/notification_operations.py` (248 lines)
- [x] Communication core in `src/core/communication_core.py` (365 lines - comprehensive)
- [x] Communication tests in `tests/tools/test_communication_tools.py` (391 lines - comprehensive)

## ⚙️ Technique Integration Checkpoints
- [x] Email operations validate recipients and attachment file existence
- [x] Message sending includes service detection and format validation
- [x] Notification operations respect system settings and user preferences
- [x] Contract validation ensures communication data integrity
- [x] Error handling provides recovery for service unavailability
- [x] Modular design enables testing with mock communication services

## ✅ Success Criteria
- [x] Email sending supports multiple recipients and attachments
- [x] Messaging operations handle SMS and iMessage service detection
- [x] Notification tools integrate with macOS notification system
- [x] Communication operations include proper validation and error handling
- [x] All modules remain under 250 lines or justify 250-400 range (core/tests comprehensive)
- [x] Communication tools handle service failures gracefully
