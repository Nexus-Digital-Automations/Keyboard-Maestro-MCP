## üìù Implementation Notes

**CRITICAL PRIORITY**: This task addresses production validation failures that are blocking successful deployment and client integration. All issues must be resolved to ensure the Keyboard Maestro MCP Server meets enterprise-grade quality standards.

**CRITICAL SYNTAX ERROR RESOLVED**: `src/types/domain_types.py` was severely corrupted with massive duplication and unterminated regex patterns. File has been completely restored with clean implementation. This resolves the primary blocker for end-to-end testing and import validation.

**Key Focus Areas**:
1. **Documentation Standards**: Ensure all documentation meets professional standards with proper licensing, formatting, and cross-references
2. **Installation Reliability**: Guarantee the installation procedure works reliably across different environments
3. **System Integration**: Ensure all modules import and integrate correctly without errors
4. **Production Readiness**: Validate all production configurations and deployment procedures work correctly
5. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing to prevent regressions and ensure reliability

**ADDER+ Technique Application**: This task demonstrates comprehensive defensive programming through systematic validation, quality assurance through rigorous testing, and system reliability through proper error handling and configuration management.

**Quality Standards**: All fixes must maintain the high-quality codebase established in TASK_1-12 while resolving the identified validation issues that are blocking production deployment.
