## üìù Implementation Notes

**ADDER+ Technique Priority**: This task serves as the culmination of all advanced programming techniques implemented throughout the project. Every aspect of the plugin system must demonstrate comprehensive technique integration:

1. **Type-Driven Development**: Complete type safety with branded types, state machines, and validation
2. **Design by Contract**: Comprehensive contracts for all operations with runtime enforcement
3. **Defensive Programming**: Multi-layered security validation and error recovery
4. **Property-Based Testing**: Extensive property testing with metamorphic and stateful testing
5. **Immutable Functions**: Pure functional core with immutable data structures
6. **Negative Space Programming**: Comprehensive boundary protection across all attack vectors

**Security Priority**: Plugin systems represent a significant security risk. This implementation must demonstrate enterprise-grade security through:
- Script content safety validation (injection prevention, dangerous pattern detection)
- Installation boundary protection (path traversal prevention, permission validation)
- Runtime resource constraints (memory limits, execution timeouts, sandbox enforcement)
- Comprehensive audit logging and violation tracking

**Quality-First Design**: This task prioritizes proper technique implementation over arbitrary file size constraints. Modularization should be driven by logical cohesion and technique requirements, not line counts. Each module should be a complete, well-architected demonstration of the assigned techniques.

**Testing Excellence**: The property-based testing implementation should serve as an exemplar of comprehensive quality assurance, demonstrating how advanced testing techniques can validate complex systems under edge conditions and adversarial scenarios.
