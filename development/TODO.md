## Navigation
üìÅ **Find detailed task instructions in**: `development/tasks/TASK_X.md`
üìã **Review protocols in**: `development/protocols/`
üìñ **Read project documentation in**: Root directory (README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) and `development/` folder

## Next Steps
1. Review available protocols in `development/protocols/`
2. Read project documentation (ARCHITECTURE.md, development/CONTRACTS.md, development/TYPES.md)
3. Start with TASK_6 in `development/tasks/TASK_6.md`
4. Update status here when beginning work to prevent conflicts

## Team Coordination
Before starting any task:
1. Update status to "IN_PROGRESS" and add your name
2. Check dependencies in the specific task file
3. Follow the protocol references for methodology
4. Update progress regularly to avoid conflicts

## Recent Progress Notes
- All core foundation tasks (1-5) completed with ADDER+ principles
- Modular code organization maintained with scripts under 250 lines
- System ready for advanced integration features
- Next focus: System Integration Tools with defensive programming and error recovery
