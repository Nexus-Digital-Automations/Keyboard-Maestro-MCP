## Breaking Changes Guide

### Version 1.0.0
**No breaking changes** - This is the initial production release.

### Version 0.6.0
**File Operations API Change**

*Before:*
```python
result = await client.call_tool("km_file_operations", {
    "operation": "copy",
    "source_path": "/path/to/source",
    "destination_path": "/path/to/dest"
})
# Result: {"success": true}
```

*After:*
```python
result = await client.call_tool("km_file_operations", {
    "operation": "copy", 
    "source_path": "/path/to/source",
    "destination_path": "/path/to/dest"
})
# Result: {
#   "success": true,
#   "metadata": {
#     "file_size": 1024,
#     "timestamp": "2025-06-17T10:00:00Z",
#     "operation_id": "file_op_123"
#   }
# }
```

**Migration:** Update result parsing to handle the new metadata structure.

**Window Management Coordinate System**

*Before:*
```python
# Relative positioning
await client.call_tool("km_window_manager", {
    "operation": "move",
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200}  # Relative to current position
})
```

*After:*
```python
# Absolute positioning
await client.call_tool("km_window_manager", {
    "operation": "move", 
    "position": {"x": 100, "y": 200}  # Absolute screen coordinates
})
```

**Migration:** Convert all relative window positions to absolute coordinates.
