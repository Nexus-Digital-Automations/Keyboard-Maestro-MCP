## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: FastMCP Framework Selection
**Decision**: Use FastMCP over official MCP SDK
**Rationale**: Production-focused toolkit with simplified APIs, authentication, and deployment features
**Consequences**: Faster development, better maintainability, production-ready features out of box

### ADR-002: AppleScript Pool Management
**Decision**: Implement connection pooling for AppleScript execution
**Rationale**: Reduce overhead of AppleScript execution and improve performance
**Consequences**: 3x performance improvement, better resource utilization, complexity in connection management

### ADR-003: Branded Type System
**Decision**: Implement domain-specific branded types (MacroId, VariableId, etc.)
**Rationale**: Compile-time safety, prevent parameter confusion, improve code clarity
**Consequences**: Better type safety, more verbose code, excellent documentation and debugging

### ADR-004: Multi-layered Validation
**Decision**: Implement validation at type, contract, security, and resource boundaries
**Rationale**: Defense in depth, early error detection, comprehensive boundary protection
**Consequences**: Robust error handling, slight performance overhead, excellent security posture

### ADR-005: Functional Core/Imperative Shell Pattern
**Decision**: Separate pure business logic from I/O operations
**Rationale**: Testability, predictability, easier debugging and maintenance
**Consequences**: Clean architecture, easier testing, more modular codebase

### ADR-006: Property-Based Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Use Hypothesis for comprehensive testing with generated test cases
**Rationale**: Better bug detection, edge case coverage, specification verification
**Consequences**: Higher confidence in correctness, more complex test setup, excellent quality assurance

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Type-Driven Development Excellence

```python
# Branded types for domain safety
MacroId = NewType('MacroId', str)
VariableId = NewType('VariableId', str)
GroupId = NewType('GroupId', str)

# State machines with phantom types
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MacroExecutionState:
    macro_id: MacroId
    status: ExecutionStatus
    start_time: datetime
    context: ExecutionContext
```

### 2. Contract-Driven Development

```python
@require(lambda macro_id: is_valid_macro_id(macro_id))
@ensure(lambda result: result.success or result.has_error_details())
async def execute_macro(macro_id: MacroId, ctx: Context) -> ExecutionResult:
    """Execute macro with comprehensive contract validation"""
```

### 3. Defensive Programming Patterns

```python
def secure_macro_execution(self, macro_id: MacroId, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> ExecutionResult:
    """Multi-layered boundary enforcement"""
    # Contract boundaries
    assert macro_id is not None, "Contract violation: macro_id required"
    
    # Security boundaries  
    assert self._permission_checker.can_execute(macro_id), "Permission denied"
    assert not self._contains_malicious_patterns(params), "Security violation"
    
    # Resource boundaries
    assert self._resource_monitor.can_allocate(), "Resource exhaustion"
    
    # Business logic boundaries
    assert self._macro_exists(macro_id), "Macro not found"
```

### 4. Property-Based Testing Implementation

```python
@given(st.text(min_size=1), st.dictionaries(st.text(), st.text()))
def test_macro_execution_properties(macro_name, variables):
    result = execute_macro_with_variables(macro_name, variables)
    
    # Idempotence property
    result2 = execute_macro_with_variables(macro_name, variables)
    assert result.status == result2.status
    
    # State preservation property
    assert get_system_state() == initial_state_snapshot
```
